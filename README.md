This repository contains the medium-level or above coding challenges that I have sorted or have been working on from HackRank.

(Medium)Words Score - Consider that vowels in the alphabet are a, e, i, o, u and y.
Function score_words takes a list of lowercase words as an argument and returns a score as follows:
The score of a single word is  if the word contains an even number of vowels. Otherwise, the score of this word is . The score for the whole list of words is the sum of scores of all words in the list.

(Medium)Athlete Sort - You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of  athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on). You are required to sort the data based on the Kth attribute and print the final resulting table.Note that K is indexed from 0 to M-1, where M is the number of attributes. Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.

(Difficult)You are given a function f(x) = x*x. You are also given K lists. The i^th list consists of Ni elements.
You have to pick one element from each list so that the value from the equation below is maximized:
S = (f(x1)+f(x2)+...+f(xk))%M
Xi denotes the element picked from the ith list . Find the maximized value Smax obtained.
denotes the modulo operator.
Note that you need to take exactly one element from each list, not necessarily the largest element. You add the squares of the chosen elements and perform the modulo operation. The maximum value that you can obtain, will be the answer to the problem.

(Medium)Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.

Game Rules

Both players are given the same string, .
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string .

For Example:
String  = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.
